                <hr>
                <p>We work with clients to develop proprietary and cutting edge algorithms that accelerate business and financial success. While our goal is to provide open source software to liberate analytical minds, we also recognize the need for support. The good news is we can help. So, why work with us?</p>

                <h5>Data Science Scale on Demand</h5>
                <p>Data scientists are at a premium and the good ones are difficult to come by. Don't be bound by this adage. Data science is our core competency. <em>We have a network of data scientists that are experts in their areas</em>. This allows us to scale as needed, on demand.</p>

                <h5>Reduce Your IT Burdon</h5>
                <p>IT departments are overloaded and under staffed resulting in backlogs that can extend years. We have access to a network of IT professionals that are ready to help when needed. The result is that <em>project lead times go from years to months</em>. If you're interested in keeping projects on schedule and within budget, let's talk.</p>

                <h5>One Secure Contract</h5>
                <p>Enterprises don't outsource because it takes months to vet consultants and security and maintenance is a big concern . With Business Science, there's one contract at the onset. After that you're setup for <em>all the data science and IT services your organization can handle</em>. Further, we offer <strong>optional long-term maintenance agreements</strong> so your organization has peace of mind.</p>
