__Data science education is largely not delivering results.__ Both academia and massive online open courses (MOOCs) have major issues. The bottom line is that students are leaving these programs not able to apply their skills to solve real-world business challenges. This gap between data science skills and business application is what Business Science solves - measured by the student's actual application of tools and concepts in the real-world.  

> Delivering __business value__. This is the true measure of an educational program. One that's often missed.

## Summary {#summary}

This article explains in detail issues with the data science educational system and how Business Science is challenging convention with a new approach that is focused on __delivering business value__. 

- __For those that want to cut to the chase__ - The _Summary_ contains visuals describing the product comparison and the business-focused approach to data science education that Business Science has developed. 

- __For those that want the full story__ - Read the article starting with [The Details](#details). The article puts everything into context with data and information to support this journey. 

### Issues with Data Science Education

Teaching success is measured by the students ability to apply their knowledge to solve real-world problems. __Otherwise the "education" is a waste of time.__

![Product Comparison](/assets/2019-01-14-how-to-learn-data-science/product_comparison.png)
<p class="date text-center">Product Comparison: Business Science meets critical needs in Data Science Education</p>

__Academia:__

- __Overly theoretical__ - Students leave not knowing how to apply tools

- __High cost__ - Students leave with high debt. In data science, it can take 3 to 9 months to get a job.

- __Loss of focus__ - University programs are increasingly becoming inefficient and lacking customer focus. Many programs are dated. 

__MOOCs:__

- __No social interaction__ - Most online course completion rates are in 5% - 10% range due to ___low social involvement___ and other benefits you get in a University Program. 

- __No student screening__ - All students are not created equally. The best students make a commitment. They need to be selected and committed. 

- __No mentorship__ - The best teachers become mentors. Mentors provide guidance.  

- __Limited application to real-world problems__ - Most educators lack real-world experience. 

__True Cost:__

Students leave programs with the belief they are ready. The reality is most students struggle in the real-world. The result is a waste in time and money in these programs that deliver false hope.

#### Business Science is different

- __Instructors have real-world experience__ 

- __Projects simulate real-world application__ 

- __Mentorship guides students__

- __Social community provides learning network__

- __Value is high compared to cost__

- __Integrated curriculum__ - MOST IMPORTANT - More on this below

### Applying Data Science in a business workflow

Data science in the real-world comprises a complex set of activities that can be best visualized as a process workflow. The process begins with a business problem and ends by generating business value. 

> Business value is only generated by implementing process changes that positively impact organizational decision making. 

![Business Science Course Curriculum and Progression](/assets/2019-01-14-how-to-learn-data-science/data_science_workflow_tools_overlayed.png)
<p class="date text-center">Data Science Workflow, R-Track Tools Overlayed</p>


Through this process, the data scientist needs to spend time doing:

- __Prepararation (70%)__ - Acquiring, formatting, and cleaning data

- __Experimentation (20%)__ - Hypothesizing, transforming, visualizing, modeling, and validating (iterative process)

- __Distribution (10%)__ - Business reporting, and deploying data science-driven applications

Many tools are used to implement data science within an organization. Learning them can be thought of as a hill climb. 

### Applied Data Science education is a hill climb.

Learning the tools begins with the foundations and moving through advanced tools and techniques. This is an example of what it takes to learn data science from our R-Track.  

![Data Science Hill Climb](/assets/2019-01-14-how-to-learn-data-science/data_science_hill_climb.png)

<p class="date text-center">Data Science Hill Climb</p>

The tools are just tools. The student needs context to apply the tools. This is where Business Science is different. We design courses around real problems. The student learns the tools in an integrated fashion while sovling problems.

### Here's how Business Science closes the gap between data science skills and business value.

The [Business Science Curriculum](https://university.business-science.io/) combines the problem-solving in real world applications within a series of integrated courses. Through the process, the student learns:

- Data Science Foundations

- Advanced Machine Learning and Consulting Frameworks

- Web Application Development

![Business Science Course Curriculum and Progression](/assets/2019-01-14-how-to-learn-data-science/curriculum_progression.png)
<p class="date text-center">
<a href="https://university.business-science.io/">R-Track Curriculum, Business Science University</a>
</p>

Each program solves projects. The R-Track teaches the students to:

- __Marketing Project (DS4B 101-R)__ - Segment the customer base to help Marketing with email segmentation and higher engagement

- __Research and Development Project (DS4B 101-R)__ - Develop a regression model to determine a new product pricing strategy

- __Human Resources Project (DS4B 201-R and 301-R)__ - Develop a state-of-the-art machine learning model using `H2O` Automated Machine Learning and deploy in a `Shiny` web application.

This is how knoweledge is built progressively. Students learn core skills the way they would when they complete an on-the-job project with a client or within your organziation.

## Modern Education, A System Being Challenged {#modern-education}

Education of complex subjects such as data science is nothing new. Instructors have been educating since the dawn of time. I'll spare you the details of education in acient civilazation, but instead focus on modern education - the ___Modern College and University System___. 

Modern education has been formalized as a complex system of colleges and universities spread across the world that offer mainly four-year degrees. The system has developed over 300+ years from beginnings of first published academic journals in the 18th century. 

By the 20th century, university education was largely a way to gain employment. Degrees from prestegious institutions had become highly sought after as the belief that the best schools provided the best educations propagated. Employers seeking able-bodies looked to academia for highly prepared students capable of entering the "real-world". 

In recent years, this four-year degree system has been challenged. __Education costs are _skyrocketing_ and organizations are becoming skeptical of the 4-year-degree-system.__ 

![Tuition Trends](/assets/2019-01-14-how-to-learn-data-science/tuition_trends.png)

Source: <a href= "https://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/tuition-fees-room-board-over-time">Trends in Higher Education, collegeboard.org</a>
</p>


The reality is that students are having a challenging time gaining employment especially in data science. It can take 3 to 9 months to land a job, which is different than when I graduated 2000s, a time when a degree from a good university virtually made it certain you got a job. This is a tough pill to swallow when a student leaves academia with a mountain of debt and debt-payments coming due.

## Academia, Profit and lack of Customer Focus Opens the Doors for Innovation {#academia}

![Roadmap For Disruption](/assets/2019-01-14-how-to-learn-data-science/roadmap_for_disruption.png)

<p class="date text-center">
Source: <a href= "https://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2014/09/the-education-business-road-map-for.html">The Education Business: A Road Map for Distruption</a>
</p>

In an article titled ["The Education Business: A Road Map for Distruption"](https://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2014/09/the-education-business-road-map-for.html), Aswath Damodaran, Professor of Finance at the Stern School of Business at NYU, makes the following points:

- __The educational system is a for-profit business__ - Academic systems (Universities) offer a product/service that generates and economic surplus.

- __The educational system has lost focus__ - Educational programs are inefficient and lack customer focus

- __The educational system has a moat__ - Bundled products including a social network, entertainment, and career placement in addition to coursework. Intertia because people largely are slow to change their minds. 


The issues with profit and lost focus in academia are opening the doors for lower-cost alternative education through online programs. However, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are imperfect as well. 

## Online Education, An Imperfect System {#mooc}

The online MOOC system is alive and thriving. Programs like Udemy, Udacity, Coursera, and DataCamp boast millions of users by providing low-cost systems for data science education. 

__However, low-cost MOOCs are not having the effect on mainstream education that one might think. Here's why.__

In Aswath Damodaran's article, he points out that most entrepreneurs in the space that have tried to disrupt the system have been technology people that don't quite understand the education business:

- __It's not just about the classes__ - Most online course completion rates are in 5% - 10% range. This is embarrassingly low. The reason is due to ___low social involvement___ and other benefits you get in a University Program. 

- __Screening students matters__ - All students are not created equally. The best students make a commitment. They need to be selected. 

- __Good teachers and content__ - Most online education does not have the content to deliver. Teaching is different than having knowledge. Good teachers provide content that connects the dots.

Ultimately, teaching success is measured by the students ability to apply their knowledge to solve real-world problems. __Otherwise the "education" is a waste of time.__



## The Business Science Mission {#mission}

We see what Aswath Damodaran sees - a system that is imperfect. __A system delivering false hopes.__ 

> The ___true cost___ is that students believe by getting degrees or taking MOOCs that they are somehow prepared for the real-world. This is not the case.

### The mission at Business Science is to close the gap between education and real-world application 

Here's what we are doing differently:

![Product Comparison](/assets/2019-01-14-how-to-learn-data-science/product_comparison.png)



- __Instructors with real-world experience__ - This is founded on my belief that ___applied education___ is critically important. Most students are leaving institutions with a disproportionate amount of knowledge that is theoretical. When the get to the real-world, they are out-of-place and in some cases incompetant. They lack the fundamental connection between business problems and knowledge, which disconnects their skills from the business value that they seek to unlock. 

- __Business projects simulating real-world application__ - This is key! Simulating the environment that approximates the real-world as closely as possible leads to an amazing thing - students actually see the end goal and learn to think creative problem-solving. This comes out in the questions they ask while they are learning. They begin to question approaches, focusing less on code and more on problem-solving.

- __Mentorship guides students__ - Many students desire more than just a good course, they need a mentor to bounce ideas off of and help get through sticking points. Class sizes are not in the millions of people, but rather the hundreds of students that have made the commitment. This makes mentorship possible. 

- __Community Involvement__ - Social networking is an area of continuous exploration for Business Science. We've implemented a communal Slack channel, which has led to conversation between students that would otherwise not take place. What I have seen is students that are driven to help each other, provide resources as they are learning, and build a sense of community between likeminded individuals with similar interests. 

## The True Differentiator: Integration {#integration}

The approach at Business Science is different than other MOOCs. We provide:

- Project-based learning
- Mentorship
- Community Involvment

But, that just a small part of the difference. The true differentiator is...

### An Integrated Curriculum

![Business Science Course Curriculum and Progression](/assets/2019-01-14-how-to-learn-data-science/curriculum_progression.png)

<p class="date text-center">Integrated Data Science Curriculum</p>

The true differentiator is the integrated curriculum: the courses are crafted differently. Our curriculum is:

- __Long-form__ - Courses take several weeks to complete because of the project nature and the level of detail that we provide. Students learn all of the tools needed to solve the problem while focusing on the problem at hand. In most cases this involves learning 10+ code libraries and hundreds of functions per course. 

- __Real-world experience__ - We are crafting courses from personal experience about what works and what does not while solving real business problems. This results in courses that are a cut above. They integrate real-world experience, tips, best-practices

- __Integrated curriculum__ - Most important to the notion of learning data science is to have a logical progression of courses that build on each other very similar to how a University program crafts a 4-year degree... except our goal is much faster. Here's an example from our R-Track:
    
    - __Business Analysis with R (DS4B 101-R)__ - Teaches the foundations of data science including data cleaning, manipulation, visualization, functional programming, modeling, and business reporting. This is necessary to complete the next step - machine learning for business.
    
    - __Data Science for Business with R (DS4B 201-R)__ - Teaches my personal data science consulting program, [the BSPF](https://www.business-science.io/bspf.html) which teaches students how to connect data science to the business. We start by understanding the business problem using the tools learned in DS4B 101-R.
    
    - __Shiny Web Apps For Business (DS4B 301-R) (Coming soon)__ - Teaches how to take machine learning models and sophisticated data science algorithms and package them into web-based applications that the business can use to generate value.

Here's how the integration works:

- Data Science Workflow

- Data Science Hill Climb

- Data Science Projects

### Data Science Workflow {#workflow}

Data science in the real-world comprises a complex set of activities that can be best visualized as a process workflow. The process begins with a business problem and ends by generating business value. 

> Business value is only generated by implementing process changes that positively impact organizational decision making. 

![Business Science Course Curriculum and Progression](/assets/2019-01-14-how-to-learn-data-science/data_science_workflow_tools_overlayed.png)
<p class="date text-center">Data Science Workflow, R-Track Tools Overlayed</p>


Through this process, the data scientist needs to spend time doing:

- __Prepararation (70%)__ - Acquiring, formatting, and cleaning data

- __Experimentation (20%)__ - Hypothesizing, transforming, visualizing, modeling, and validating (iterative process)

- __Distribution (10%)__ - Business reporting, and deploying data science-driven applications

Many tools are used to implement data science within an organization. Learning them can be thought of as a hill climb. 

### Data Science Hill Climb {#hill-climb}

Consider the learning process like climbing a hill. When overlayed, the tools learned through the integrated data science curriculum look something like this.
 
![Data Science Hill Climb](/assets/2019-01-14-how-to-learn-data-science/data_science_hill_climb.png)

<p class="date text-center">Data Science Hill Climb</p>

Initially, the hill climb looks daunting. How is the student going to learn that many tools? It's going to take years, right?

Wrong. __Weeks.__

When training is completed through an integrated program, the student can accomplish the hill climb much faster. If we take another look at the curriculum, each phase is between 6 - 10 weeks. In total, this is 24 weeks to complete everything. Less than 6 months and likely much faster depending on the students commitment. 

![Business Science Course Curriculum and Progression](/assets/2019-01-14-how-to-learn-data-science/curriculum_progression.png)

<p class="date text-center">Integrated Data Science Curriculum</p>

### Data Science Projects

Each course integrates projects. The R-Track teaches the students to:

- __Marketing Project (DS4B 101-R)__ - Segment the customer base to help Marketing with email segmentation and higher engagement

- __Research and Development Project (DS4B 101-R)__ - Develop a regression model to determine a new product pricing strategy

- __Human Resources Project (DS4B 201-R and 301-R)__ - Develop a state-of-the-art machine learning model using `H2O` Automated Machine Learning and deploy in a `Shiny` web application.

This is how knoweledge is built progressively. Students learn core skills the way they would when they complete an on-the-job project with a client or within your organziation.

## Results {#results}

The results speak for themeselves.
