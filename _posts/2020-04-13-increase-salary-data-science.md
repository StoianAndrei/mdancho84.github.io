Here's one Business Science Student who received a 40% pay increase in about a year.

Mohana Krishna Chittoor has experienced rapid career acceleration and a new found confidence in his ability to land new positions.

This was similar to my own experience honing my ability to apply the skills that I teach.  When I was still in corporate I experience a growth in income from $100k to $150k in 2 years.  And now I teach these skills to my students.


#### What did Mohana's experience look like?

## How Would A 40% Raise Impact Your Life?

The majority of us have experienced the average pay increase, because this is what most people receive. How would it feel to save your organization money or increase revenue for your organization and receive more compensation because of your work?

How would it feel to be confident that your skills are in high demand and that you would have zero difficulty finding your next data science role if you were desiring a new job?


I'm helping data scientists achieve their dreams and accelerate their career through becoming confident data science R coders for business.
