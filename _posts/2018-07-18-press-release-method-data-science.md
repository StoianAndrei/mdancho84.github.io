### DS4B Virtual Workshop: Predicting Employee Attrition <a class="anchor" id="vw"></a>

Did you know that __an organization that loses 200 high performing employees per year is essentially losing $15M/year in lost productivity__? Many organizations don't realize this because it's an indirect cost. It goes unnoticed. What if you could use data science to predict and explain turnover in a way that managers could make better decisions and executives would see results? You will learn the tools to do so in our Virtual Workshop. Here's an example of a Shiny app you will create.
