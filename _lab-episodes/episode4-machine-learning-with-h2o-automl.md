### What is AutoML?

It’s a high-level algorithm that applies many modeling approaches automatically. 

### Why use AutoML?

Each model has pros and cons. AutoML helps us converge to the best approach much faster. 

### H2O AutoML

We're excited to bring you this LIVE CODING Learning Lab with special guest [Erin LeDell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erin-ledell/), Chief Machine Learning Specialist from H2O. 

Erin will demonstrate how to use H2O.ai’s Free & Open Source Automatic Machine Learning library.
