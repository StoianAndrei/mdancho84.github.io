If you haven't heard of RMarkdown, it's an amazing tool for developing reports using a statistical programming language called R.


### How did learning RMarkdown accelerate my career?


__True Story__ - When I learned RMarkdown, my career took off because I was able to communicate data science to my boss in a format that was consistent with what he expected (PDFs). With RMarkdown, my reports also included analytical insights that only I was able to provide (using machine learning). 

In this Learning Lab, we unveil our latest educational creation - a __Product Price Prediction App!__

It uses product data from a company's product portfolio to predict new products. This enables R&D and Marketing teams to visualize portfolio gaps and determine unit pricing consistent with other products!
