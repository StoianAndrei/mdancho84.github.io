                <h3 class="text-center">Our Motivation</h3>
                <p class="text-center"><em>During an analytical endeavour, have you ever asked yourself, "Is there a better way?"</em></p>
                <br>

                <p>We believe there is, and it involves the <em>R Programming Language</em>. We provide solutions in the realm of business and financial analysis through the development of <strong>fast, scalable and user-friendly open-source R software</strong>.</p>

                <p>We seek to assist users in using our <em>Open Source R Packages</em> to solve business or financial analysis problems. Our focus is working with clients that:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Have an interest in applying <strong>data science</strong> techniques in the realm of business and finance</li>
                  <li>Are seeking a competitive edge by implementing <strong>machine learning</strong> or <strong>artificial intelligence</strong></li>
                  <li>Are interested in using R and potentially transitioning from SAS, Stata, Microsoft Excel, or any other language/platform that is not R</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We believe <em>R</em> is the right analytics approach for several reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Open-source</li>
                  <li>Over 12,000 packages employing the latest statistical &amp; visualization techniques</li>
                  <li>Web-based interactive applications with <code>Shiny</code></li>

                  <li>An active and welcoming R Community</li>
                  <li>Highly scalable</li>
