                    <p>There are three parts to making a decision: analyzing the situation, developing a strategy, and implementing the plan. While all three are important, the first is by far the most critical. Think of it akin to firing a gun. <em><strong>Analysis is your process of aiming.</strong></em> Without identifying the target, adjusting for wind, taking into account the velocity and direction of the targets motion, and characterizing all of the other <em><strong>critical features</strong></em> of the aiming process, one cannot expect to accurately or precisely fire the gun to hit the target.</p>

                    <p>This website is dedicated to the first part of the decision making process: the analysis. The mission is to evaluate important situations that we can extract value from. That is, when analyzed, data allows us to develop and implement a logical, well-informed strategy.</p>

                    <p>Hello! I'm Matt, and I'm a management professional with a background in engineering, sales, and data science. My profession is the Director of Product Engineering &amp; Market Development: I manage a Product Engineering Department, a portion of the Sales department dealing with techinical projects, and using <em><strong>Business Science</strong></em> I lead development efforts for new products, services, and markets. I have a BS in mechanical engineering and an MBA from Penn State, and a masters in industrial engineering from Pitt. I live in Happy Valley with my wonderful wife. Outside of work, my wife and I most enjoy traveling the globe.</p>

                    <p>Throughout my career, I've recognized a value in data analysis. It first started with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Excel</code>, where I developed engineering calculations using data visualizations, statistics, and VBA programming. As I transitioned into sales, my competency in Excel helped tremendously. I eventually added to my toolbox, developing database applications in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Access</code>. The tools contributed to my career progression because they got <em><strong>results</strong></em>!</p>

                    <p>Eventually, my data needs outgrew the capabilities of Excel, and I stumbled down the rabbit hole known as <em><strong>Data Science</strong></em>. I began using <code>Power BI</code> and <code>Tableau</code> for communicating analytics throughout my organization and <code class="highlighter-rouge">R</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Python</code> for managing, visualizing, and most importantly understanding data. I took several courses to "level up", and I found that the data science tools were applicable to my profession (business strategy analysis and formulation) and my hobbies (financial investments). I hope to teach and learn from others as I grow in this amazing field.</p>
