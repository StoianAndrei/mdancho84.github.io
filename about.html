                <h3 class="text-center">Our Motivation</h3>
                <p class="text-center"><em>Data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence are the future, yet the majority of businesses are <strong>not</strong> fully utilizing data science.</em></p>
                <br>
                <p>The <strong><em>critical shortage of data scientists</em></strong> makes building data science teams very difficult. Our services address this critical shortage by <em><strong>building consulting teams as needed and scaling on-demand</strong></em>. Using our <strong><em>data scientist network</em></strong>, we pair topical analytics specialists, data science experts, and data engineers as needed. Rather than focus on a single data science <em>"unicorn"</em>, our approach is <strong><em>team-based</em></strong>, which elevates the collective output and is better suited for solving real-world problems! The end result is <strong><em>data science collaboration</em></strong>, which benefits all.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We seek to assist clients in solving business and/or financial analysis problems. Our focus is working with clients that:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Have an interest in applying <strong>data science</strong> techniques in the realm of business, marketing, and finance/risk management</li>
                  <li>Are seeking a competitive edge by implementing <strong>machine learning</strong> or <strong>artificial intelligence</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>We primarily use the <em>R statistical programming language</em>. We believe <em>R</em> is the right analytics approach for several reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Open-source</li>
                  <li>Over 13,000 packages employing the latest statistical &amp; visualization techniques</li>
                  <li>Web-based interactive applications with <code>Shiny</code></li>
                  <li>Integrated tools for reporting including <code>Rmarkdown</code></li>
                  <li>Highly scalable</li>
                  <li>An active and welcoming R Community</li>
                </ul>
